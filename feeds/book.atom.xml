This volume includes adaptations of seven episodes: "Whom Gods Destroy", "The Tholian Web", "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield", "This Side of Paradise", "Turnabout Intruder", "Requiem for Methuselah", an "The Way to Eden".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1H4B4fQ"&gt;&lt;img alt="Star Trek 5 cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/star-trek-5-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories adapted in this volume are, I think, fairly average &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; fare. The adaptation of "Whom Gods Destroy" is the most interesting, but even it was better for being on screen. Meanwhile, most of the others are dull, and "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield" is positively tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several adaptations throughout this series suffer from a common flaw: certain episodes are really only interesting on account of being acted out. "Turnabout Intruder" has a rather weak plot (to say nothing of its unfortunately anti-feminist dimensions), but to the extent that it was entertaining, it was all down to Shatner's overacting as Dr. Lester. Blish's condensed prose captures none of that, while retaining the cringe-worthy story ("And most of all she wanted to murder the man who might have loved her--had her intense hatred of her own womanhood not made life with her impossible."--lovely.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above goes equally for "The Way to Eden", another very weak episode propped up (poorly) by songs, on which small support the book cannot rely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1H4B4fQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was saddled with several very unfortunate episodes, and it didn't make any more of them than the TV series did. If you've got this one, read "Whom Gods Destroy" and ignore the rest. If not, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Your time will be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="James Blish"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category><category term="science fiction"></category><category term="novelization"></category></entry><entry><title>The Making of Star Trek by Stephen E. Whitfield</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/the-making-of-star-trek-by-stephen-e-whitfield.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-03T22:45:19-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2015-07-03:other-stuff-exists/book/the-making-of-star-trek-by-stephen-e-whitfield.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In August, 1966, Stephen E. Whitfield, then in the employ of an advertising agency, was tasked with working to generate publicity for &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; toys. In consequence of his close contact with the &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; cast and crew, he became intimately familiar with the workings of the production, and pitched to Gene Roddenberry a book detailing the making of the show. With Roddenberry's approval, Whitfield began work on what was to be a thorough history of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, from its conception through the production of its first season: &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1f7C7mf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Making of Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1f7C7mf"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Making of Star Trek cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/making-of-star-trek-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitfield's book was the first of its kind: a real behind-the-scenes look at the creation of a television show, including not only Whitfield's observations, but also interviews with Roddenberry and the actors, and original artifacts from the show's production, such as the 'series format' Roddenberry wrote to sell the show to the studio, and a variety of memos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned series format is perhaps the single feature of greatest historical interest, as it describes Roddenberry's initial vision for the show. In part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;THE FORMAT&lt;/small&gt; is "Wagon Train to the Stars"--built around characters who travel to other worlds and meet the jeopardy and adventure which become our stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;THE TIME&lt;/small&gt; could be 1995 or even 2995--close enough to our times for our continuing cast to be people like us, but far enough into the future for galaxy travel to be fully established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;THE FAMILIAR LOCALE&lt;/small&gt; is their vessel--the U.S.S. &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;, a naval cruiser-size spaceship. (In the initial draft of the format, the ship was the U.S.S. &lt;em&gt;Yorktown&lt;/em&gt;.) The vessel (a permanent set) includes bridge, control rooms, crew quarters and facilities, science labs and technical departments, plus passenger and cargo accommodations. These compartments contain the wide range of personalities, some becoming Guest Star roles for stories aboard ship or on the worlds we visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;THE LEAD ROLE&lt;/small&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Captain Robert T. April&lt;/em&gt;, mid-thirties, an unusually strong and colorful personality, the commander of the cruiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;OTHER CAST REGULARS&lt;/small&gt; are a variety of excitingly different types: &lt;em&gt;"Number One"&lt;/em&gt;, a glacierlike, efficient female who serves as ship's Executive Officer; &lt;em&gt;José "Joe" Tyler&lt;/em&gt;, the brilliant but sometimes immature Navigator; &lt;em&gt;Mr. Spock&lt;/em&gt;, with a red-hued satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners; &lt;em&gt;Philip "Bones" Boyce&lt;/em&gt;, M. D., ship's doctor and worldly cynic; and uncomfortably lovely &lt;em&gt;J. M. Colt&lt;/em&gt;, the Captain's Yeoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book features a great many more original documents from the show's production that will be similarly interesting to the devoted fan. It's well worth reading for those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of rather less interest (to me, at the least) are the minutiae of the show's production. In 1968, I suppose the work of making a television show was relatively unfamiliar to the average person. Today, I think this information has permeated the collective public consciousness, and at any rate the internet will offer (up-to-date!) details to anyone interested. Happily, these duller bits are in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1f7C7mf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Making of Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an absolute treasure for the fan interested in &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt;'s history. I understand that many of these details have been republished, since, but Whitfield's book is the only source written even as the show was produced, and published contemporarily. It's well worth the time invested to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those keeping track (just me, I'm sure), this book's proper place is between Blish's &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-2-by-james-blish.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-3-by-james-blish.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note on this review: I had believed that I'd reviewed this book months ago, when I finished reading it, but I cannot turn up that review, and I have since lost my notes on the book, so this is less thorough a review than I would wish. My apologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="nonfiction"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category><category term="Stephen E.

It was the only one published in 1971, but he then picked up the pace substantially, publishing four more in 1972 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553123114/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0553123114&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;linkId=GF3CSLNUKVQG32B4"&gt;&lt;img alt="Star Trek 4 cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/star-trek-4-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This volume includes adaptations of six episodes: "All Our Yesterdays", "The Devil in the Dark", "Journey to Babel", "The Menagerie", "The Enterprise Incident", and "A Piece of the Action".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the short stories are substantially similar to the episodes as aired, with the exception of "The Menagerie". That episode, if you recall, was a retooling of the pilot: Spock is court martialed for bringing Captain Pike back to Talos IV and presents the video from the pilot episode "The Cage" as evidence. Blish elected to omit the frame story and simply adapt the pilot episode itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several good stories, here, though not all of equal merit. I enjoyed the episode "A Piece of the Action", but I think that the short story falls flat--it was never much of a story, and most of its appeal was in the seeing. Ditto "All Our Yesterdays". The other four stories are quite entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, the quality of the adaptations is good, but I find myself disappointed that they are so similar to the episodes. I suspect this is due to the book being written after &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; had finished airing, meaning that it was no longer necessary for Blish to rely on early draft scripts. This is good, if what you want are faithful adaptations of TV episodes, but it was the differences that made me interested in the books in the first place, so I think it's a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553123114/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0553123114&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;linkId=GF3CSLNUKVQG32B4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a worthwhile book, containing several entertaining stories. If any of those are your favorite episodes, I'd encourage you to give it a try, if only for the sake of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="James Blish"></category><category term="novelization"></category><category term="science fiction"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category></entry><entry><title>Star Trek 3 by James Blish</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-3-by-james-blish.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-03T22:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-11-24:other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-3-by-james-blish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another day, another collection of &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; novelizations. Today I'm looking at James Blish's &lt;em&gt;Star Trek 3&lt;/em&gt;, published in April 1969. It collects seven adaptations: "The Trouble with Tribbles", "The Last Gunfight" (an adaptation of "Spectre of the Gun"), "The Doomsday Machine", "Assignment: Earth", "Mirror, Mirror", "Friday's Child", and "Amok Time".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAZBGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000HAZBGQ&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=YKS4TAMG7E23S65P"&gt;&lt;img alt="Star Trek 3 cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/star-trek-3-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't notice any substantial departures from the episodes in any of the stories except "Friday's Child", which treats the character of Eleen rather differently. "The Doomsday Machine" and "The Last Gunfight" have some small changes, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is, like &lt;a href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-2-by-james-blish.html"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, fairly enjoyable. Although I've not found the series to be exceptional, it seems that contemporary readers were more impressed: in the introduction, James Blish describes some of his previous work (twenty-seven novels and short story collections, including a Hugo winner). Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note these figures not to brag--well, not entirely, anyhow--but as background for one astonishing fact: I have received more mail about my two previous &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; books than I have about &lt;em&gt;all my other work put together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been receiving letters "at an average rate of two a day ever since January 1967." Of note is that "most of [the letter writers] say that they have never read, or seen, any science fiction before &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, or if they have, that they hadn't liked it." To fans looking for more information, he recommends &lt;em&gt;The Making of Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen E. Whitfield. I'm reading that book, now, and it's fairly interesting (with some caveats--review forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of the introduction, he very casually reveals his next project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, too, to those who asked that I write an original &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; novel. Both the studio and Bantam agreed, somewhat to my surprise, that this was a good idea, so it's in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book in question, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553246348/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=0553246348&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=PVPDPR22H6RSQVPS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spock Must Die!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, would be published in February 1970, nearly a year later, and Blish's next volume of adaptations would not be published until July 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit that I'm really looking forward to &lt;em&gt;Spock Must Die!&lt;/em&gt; giving me a break from these adaptations. All the same, with adaptations of popular episodes like "Mirror, Mirror" and "Amok Time" (and even "The Trouble with Tribbles", if you're in a less serious mood), &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAZBGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000HAZBGQ&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=YKS4TAMG7E23S65P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a nice afternoon's diversion.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="James Blish"></category><category term="novelization"></category><category term="science fiction"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category></entry><entry><title>Star Trek 2 by James Blish</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-2-by-james-blish.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-03T22:33:19-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-11-21:other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-2-by-james-blish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553108115/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=0553108115&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=IEDQZ4FFDHFKNNRF"&gt;&lt;img alt="Star Trek 2 cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/star-trek-2-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Blish's novelizations of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episodes continue in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek 2&lt;/em&gt;, published in February 1968. This volume includes novelizations of "Arena", "A Taste of Armageddon", "Tomorrow is Yesterday", "Errand of Mercy", "Court Martial", "Operation--Annihilate!", "The City on the Edge of Forever", and "Space Seed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each short story is typically quite similar to the episode being adapted, though there are some differences. Notably, the ending of "Operation--Annihilate!" is very different. In the episode, they expose Spock to a massive blast of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, and believe that they have blinded him. Upon discovering that the visible light was unnecessary, they regret that they have &lt;em&gt;needlessly&lt;/em&gt; blinded him. In the end, though, he recovers, and they save the planet using the same procedure, on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short story, the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; instead seeks out the central concentration of the mind-controlling creatures and destroys it with missiles, which leaves the creatures directionless and easily dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the writing in this volume better than that in its predecessor, though I couldn't point at a definite reason why. It still suffers from the problem that the episodes on which the stories are based relied heavily on the visual element, and so are somewhat lacking as short stories. They don't generally have any big ideas behind them, and if they do they don't explore them very thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that some of the stories here have merit. Not much can be done for "Arena" or "Court Martial", but I can certainly see "A Taste of Armageddon" being worked into something more substantial and interesting, and of course that has already been done for "Space Seed" in Greg Cox's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0O22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000FC0O22&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=BWOUJ2F36227POEL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eugenics Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series, not to mention &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I9Z8B2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002I9Z8B2&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=LATKRVCNFFFAMU7V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be too negative, I did have a pleasant surprise when reading "Tomorrow is Yesterday". After their time-traveling adventure, Spock comments, "And so we have revised Omar." Upon Kirk's request for clarification, he specifies that he means "the verse about the moving finger." This refers to &lt;em&gt;The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám&lt;/em&gt;, as translated by Edward FitzGerald:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all they Tears wash out a Word of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only just read the &lt;em&gt;Rubáiyát&lt;/em&gt; about a year ago (highly recommended, incidentally), so seeing this reference by Spock is a treat. Sadly, I don't recall him being quite so literary in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its general improvement over its predecessor, I can recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553108115/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=0553108115&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=IEDQZ4FFDHFKNNRF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fans looking for a quick read, or another perspective on the episodes, and the new ending to "Operation--Annihilate!" and the incorporation of content from Heinlein's original script in "The City on the Edge of Forever" provide a little added value.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="James Blish"></category><category term="novelization"></category><category term="science fiction"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category></entry><entry><title>Mission to Horatius by Mack Reynolds</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/mission-to-horatius-by-mack-reynolds.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-03T22:53:04-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-11-20:other-stuff-exists/book/mission-to-horatius-by-mack-reynolds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just written about James Blish's &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, the first &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; book ever published, but that book contained only adaptations of television episodes. The first original &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; story published--and, indeed, the only such book published during the initial airing of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;--is Mack Reynolds's &lt;em&gt;Mission to Horatius&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067102812X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=067102812X&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=OJLIDPXQHYX7S63M"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mission to Horatius cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/mission-to-horatius-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; has been out on patrol for a long time, and just when they were heading for a much needed break, they are ordered to a distant star system--Horatius--from which a distress call has originated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horatius has three colonized planets: Neolithia, Mythra, and Bavarya. Neolithia was colonized by people who wanted a less technologically dependent way of life, and its inhabitants have only very primitive technology--not even iron. Mythra was colonized by people fleeing religious persecution, and is ruled by a small class of religious elites. Bavarya, the most recently settled, was colonized by political dissidents, and its leader is a militaristic man called &lt;em&gt;Nummer Ein&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; is not welcomed by the inhabitants of any of the three planets, but they have a duty to determine who called for help, and render aid if they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; has troubles of its own. It has been far too long since the crew has been planetside, and Dr. McCoy fears an outbreak of space cafard, a deadly psychological condition caused by the extreme ennui of protracted space travel. If the crew of the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; don't get leave soon, they may tear themselves apart from the strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission to Horatius&lt;/em&gt; is a quick, easy read. With its A plot of the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; investigating a distress call, its B plot of McCoy's concerns about space cafard, and a good dose of comedy, it reads very like an episode of the show. Which is not to say that it's the most well-written possible book, of course. Kirk is rather cavalier in his response to the situation in which he finds himself, and his actions are not what one would expect of an ambassador of the Federation (as Kirk calls himself). He repeatedly ignores the wishes of the governments of the planets they're visiting, despite himself noting that he must not do that. He even says, "We shall see what our Bavaryan bullyboys have to offer," when it is Kirk himself who is acting the bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not flawless, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067102812X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=067102812X&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=OJLIDPXQHYX7S63M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission to Horatius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a suitably enjoyable read for young audiences, for which it was intended.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Mack Reynolds"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category><category term="science fiction"></category></entry><entry><title>Star Trek by James Blish</title><link href="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-by-james-blish.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-03T22:39:28-04:00</updated><author><name>Tracy Poff</name></author><id>tag:sopoforic.github.io,2014-11-19:other-stuff-exists/book/star-trek-by-james-blish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've read a good number of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; books, over the years. Since I came rather late to the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; universe, I'm quite used to thinking of the expanded universe as a sprawling thing, composed of many books by a similarly vast number of authors. Of course, it wasn't always this way. Once, there were no &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; books at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, there was one: &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; by James Blish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1553056299/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=1553056299&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=LX4HAYTTNJHOP5KN"&gt;&lt;img alt="Star Trek cover" src="https://sopoforic.github.io/other-stuff-exists/images/star-trek-1-cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1553056299/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=1553056299&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;tag=othstuexi-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=LX4HAYTTNJHOP5KN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of seven short story adaptations of television episodes, namely "Charlie's Law" (aired as "Charlie X"), "Dagger of the Mind", "The Unreal McCoy" (aired as "The Man Trap"), "Balance of Terror", "The Naked Time", "Miri", and "The Conscience of the King".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blish's adaptations were based on early draft scripts of the episodes, so the stories in this collection are not exactly the same as those that aired, though the differences tend to be minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the stories varies. For the most part, they are clearly uninspired adaptations of television scripts: lots of dialogue, limited description, and very little of anything else. They serve well enough as summaries of the episodes, but they're not particularly engaging, and I don't think they give enough detail for readers who haven't already seen the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories are inferior to the television episodes, too, in those cases where the acting is particularly noteworthy: Morgan Woodward's performance as Simon van Gelder in "Dagger of the Mind" and Arnold Moss's performance as Karidian in "The Conscience of the King" brought the characters to life in a way the lifeless dialogue in the short stories cannot match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have one good point, however: the adaptation of "Balance of Terror" is substantially better than the other stories. Indeed, it's so different that I'd have guessed it was written by another author entirely. Where the other adaptations are soulless collections of dialogue and stage direction, "Balance of Terror" takes some time to consider the import of events and the relationships between the characters, and gives more detail than is strictly required to understand the events. This added flavor places it head and shoulders above the rest: it's a satisfying and entertaining short story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blish's book was apparently very popular. Published in January 1967, it was in its fifth printing by June of that year, and in its eighth printing by June 1968. My copy is from a 25th printing in February 1977 and claims "Over 8 million copies in print.", though that might possibly be including the later books in the series. At any rate, it was popular enough that the series was gathered into two different omnibus sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However interesting this book may be as a window into the past, I cannot recommend it. I don't regret the time spent reading it, but those simply interested in reading a work of science fiction should probably choose a different book.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="James Blish"></category><category term="novelization"></category><category term="science fiction"></category><category term="Star Trek"></category></entry></feed>
