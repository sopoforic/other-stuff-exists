I've a particular interest in how fictional characters and worlds change over the years. How they are handled by different authors, in different media, in different decades and centuries fascinates me.

All serial fiction has shades of this, but one could hardly ask for a better example than *Star Trek*: conceived in 1960 as a television program, first aired on September 8, 1966, and then expanding into several television series comprising over 700 episodes, 12 movies (and counting), hundreds of books, and numerous comics, video games, and all manner of other material.

My project is ambitious: watch everything; read everything; play the games; and learn about any of the material that I can't experience firsthand. I've got a good start, having watched over the years all of the television shows except the animated series, but that leaves the much vaster expanded universe mostly unexplored.

Whenever possible, I'll be reading the books in publication order, to get a better feel for how the *Star Trek* universe actually developed.
